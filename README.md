# edu
A command line interface for automating school interactions. This is a work in progress and it will be impossible to support the system that all schools use but this project will do its best to support the more popular systems (i.e. canvas).

I will not make any promises in terms of compatibility except that I will probably break things in the future.

Email me with any questions, harrybrown98@gmail.com.

## Canvas
To use any of the features that interact with canvas (the update and canvas commands), you need to [get an api token](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-16005-42121018197) for your student account. For more info read the [configuration docs](/docs/config.md#token)

## Configuration
See the [configuration docs](/docs/config.md). For config example, see [my example config](/docs/example_config.yml)
